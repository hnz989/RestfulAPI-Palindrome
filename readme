For **Problem 1:**
Given a string _s_, find the longest palindromic substring in _s_. You may assume that the maximum length of _s_ is 1000.
My soution is in Problem 1 folder, file name is: testPalindrome.java

For **Microservice Problem:**
Write a Spring Boot micro-service that completes the following:

1. Receives string input over an API
2. Stores the longest palindrome in provided database
3. Retrieves the stored palindrome over an API

You should be able to run your micro-service locally and use an API client (such as PostMan) to test your results.

The whole RestfulAPI-Palindrome project is the solution.
This is a SpringBoot project. You can import as existing Maven project.

To test it:
1. please run the project as Springboot application. 
2. Open Postman: 
   1) Test preload palngdrome strings use Get mothod: http://localhost:8080/api/
   2) Test new input strings use POST mothod: http://localhost:8080/api/
      use JSON format, for example: {
	                                     "inputStr": "yyayyupa"
                                    }
                                    
Problem 2/Solution?:
Have the function BinaryReversal(str) take the str parameter being passed, which will be a positive integer, take its binary representation (padded to the nearest N * 8 bits), reverse that string of bits, and then finally return the new reversed string in decimal form. For example: if str is "47" then the binary version of this integer is 101111 but we pad it to be 00101111. Your program should reverse this binary string which then becomes: 11110100 and then finally return the decimal version of this string, which is 244.

My soution is in Problem 2 folder, file name is: ReverseBinary.java
